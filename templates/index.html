    <h1>Welcome to the Video Game API! ðŸŽ®</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
        This is the Video Game API. A small project developed by
        <a href="https://joshblewitt.dev/">Joshua Blewitt</a>. This API allows
        authenticated users to get, add and delete video games to a database.
    </p>
    <p>The API is free to use!</p>
    <p>If you want to see the repo and take a look at the code, click <a
            href="https://gitlab.com/JoshBl_/python-flask-api">here.</a></p>
    <p>The repo also includes a Postman JSON file of example calls to the API.</p>

    <h2>How to use the API</h2>

    <h3>Authentication</h3>
    <p>The API uses JWT for authentication. At the moment, there is no way to register for an account. There is a hard
        coded credential to use to authenticate a session.</p>
    <p>Please use the following JSON:</p>
    <code>
        {
            "username": "Josh",
            "password": "mypass"
        }
    </code>
    <p>This can be used to access the <strong>/login</strong> endpoint</p>
    <p>This will return an access token that can be used with the rest of the API</p>

    <h3>Display games</h3>
    <p>To display all games in the database, you will need to use the <strong>/displayGames</strong> endpoint. Submit a
        GET request to this endpoint and you will see a list of all the games in the database.</p>
    <p>Example response:</p>
    <code>
        {
            "Games": [
                {
                    "Game": {

        }
    </code>

    <h3>Add game</h3>
    <p>To add a game to the database, you will need to use the <strong>/addGame</strong> endpoint and submit a POST request.</p>

    <p></p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        The API will check if the year provided is in an integer format and if the request has values that aren't null. The API will return a 400 status code if the request doesn't follow the format.

    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
